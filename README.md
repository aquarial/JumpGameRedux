# JumpGameRedux

In Jump Gam, the player controls a square centered on the screen by clicking. The square usually just follows the laws of gravity (besides sticking to walls), but after the user clicks the square is launched toward the point of impact, with a velocity proportional to the distance of the impact.

This is a remake of a game I made in 2014.

This code is cleaner, and more organized. Structure influenced by the Model-View pattern.
